The better one can communicate what he wants, the better someone else can help him.
The easier one can make themselves understood, the more he will reach out for help.

This repo is for recording user input-output;
for the purpose of training/fine-tuning NNs to guess what the user wants: and make that happen.


## TODO:

1. Implement use of AR/VR glasses.
2. Integrate a brain waves recorder (fNIRS)
3. [MRI](https://today.duke.edu/2023/04/brain-images-just-got-64-million-times-sharper) scan while doing software engineering tasks and also reading with the portable fNIRS.
4. Use above scans to make better use of the fNIRS scans (if one goes to take an MRI scan, it should improve the use of fNIRS. With time the brain could change, MRI scan every now and then)
